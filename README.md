# Events Manager

Events app to manage your daily tasks.

## Getting Started

This steps will get you through the setup process of installing and usage of the project.

### Project contributors guide

To ensure the best compatibility you may need node version of `v10.16`. We would recommend to use NVM (Node Version Manager) for this. You can find it [Here](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

Installation

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
```

then you can run

```
nvm install `version`
```

After set node version run

```
yarn install
```

After installing all packages you just need to launch Angular dev server. Since you need the api for the requests, we need to launch the node server that receive
this requests.

To launch node server, first compile your typescript files, make shure you have typescript installed globally.

To install Typescript global you can do

```
yarn add --global typescript
```

After that, to compile server files just do

```
tsc
```

The compile server file will be at dist/out-tsc on index.js file.

```
node index.js
```

or if you have nodemon installed

```
nodemon index.js
```

To check if server is running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`

To launch Angular server

```
yarn run start
```

And Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

That's it, you are good to go!

## Running the tests

To run the tests

```
yarn run test
```
